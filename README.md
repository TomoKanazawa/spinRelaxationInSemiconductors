# Introduction
A Monte Carlo Simulation for electron spin relaxation in a excited semiconductor written in Fortran.

Quantum well is made by more than two different materials, in this case, they are Ga and As.
When you layer up thin sheets of these material alternately, energy gaps appear because of the difference of bandgaps of two materials.
This is called "quantum well", which can be treated like a well from a point of view of electron energy.

When GaAs quantum well get excited by layzer, some electrons get energy to jump out of atomic orbitals and start to move around.
